# Project: find_a_place
## Objective:
The project "find_a_place" aims to assist in finding an apartment to buy in the city of Campinas.

## Code:
The project consists of several Jupyter Notebook scripts:

- getLinks.ipynb: This script performs web scraping of the QuintoAndar website using the Selenium library to obtain links to apartments for sale in Campinas. It applies specific filters such as the number of bedrooms, parking spaces, and price range.

- getParameters.ipynb: Another web scraping script that uses Selenium to collect data for each apartment, including the number of bedrooms, area, price, etc.

- model.ipynb: This notebook contains data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), as well as the creation of predictive models to forecast apartment prices.

## Approach:
The main idea of ​​the project is to develop a robust predictive model that can identify apartments with lower-than-expected prices. Using the model allows you to explore potential opportunities for purchasing properties.
