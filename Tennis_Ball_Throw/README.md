# Project: Tennis_Ball_Throw

## Objective:
The "Tennis_Ball_Throw" project is a tennis ball launching simulator developed as part of the Product Design course at the University of Campinas (Unicamp).

## Description:
The project aims to simulate the trajectory and behavior of a tennis ball when thrown using various launch parameters such as angle, velocity, initial position, and wind velocity. It serves as a design tool to define key parameters for tennis ball launching systems. This tool assists in determining project parameters such as the range of launch velocities, specific launch angles, acceptable wind conditions, and other factors crucial for optimizing the performance and efficiency of tennis ball launching systems.

## Features:
The simulator includes the following features:

- Launch Parameters: Users can adjust parameters such as launch angle, velocity, and initial position.
- 2D Visualization: Provides 2D visualization of the trajectory and path of the tennis ball from two perspectives (from the side and above).
- Data Analysis: Allows users to analyze the trajectory data, including maximum height, range, and time of flight.
- Interactive Interface: User-friendly interface for easy adjustment of launch parameters and visualization control.

## Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to develop all stages of a feasible tennis ball launcher for training purposes. This includes designing, simulating, and optimizing the launcher's components and parameters to create an effective training tool.
